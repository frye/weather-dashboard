# Weather dashboard

## Description

The weather dashboards allows searching of current weather information together with a 5-day forecast based on given city. The cities will be saved for future reference. And previously searched weather forecast will be loaded when the page is visited subsequently. You will also have the possibility to remove cities from the history to clean things up. The timestamp in the current weather display is the timestamp for that data. So it may not always align with the real time depending on the delay.
